description: reflections on 2025.
---

Thought of taking a pause and rewinding all that has happened in the last 365 days, and boi, 2025 has been a wild ride.

Professionally, I have grown so much. From a tech support role at the start of my career to working on organization wide projects with visibility across multiple teams. That has been the best part of my job. 
I get to collaborate with some truly brilliant folks, work on the latest and cutting edge developments in the data sciency and engg thingies and there is always something new to learn.

It’s fun but also quite engaging and requires dedication, which I think is a privilege. I’m glad people can count on me now to get shit done. I feel seen, which has been a major boost to my self-esteem issues that I’ve always struggled with.
The imposter syndrome is still there. Don’t think it ever leaves and I think that’s good because it acts as a catalyst to push you a bit, to go the extra mile. I’m a firm believer of "You can always do things."

I took my first and one of many international trips this year as well. Finally went out of my comfort zone, met a lot of interesting folks along the way, and made some awesome memories with them.

From giving a organization wide tech talk, crashing motionless on the bed after coming home from work, doing shrooms on a random island in Bali, and playing volleyball for straight two hours, to falling into a pool at a brewery, surfing at Mulki, attending concerts and gigs, and the evergreen late night chais at the usual hangout spot, I found a new motivation to continue and felt like it was worth grinding a few years back and still I'm, it never stops, I don't want to. 

I was initially planning on going for a masters, but things worked out just fine in the end, I think. I’m excited to see what’s next for me. I have a couple of things planned for next year. Need something to look forward to; otherwise, you’re just existing day in and day out, and what’s the fun in that? I want to have a story to tell. So yeah, let’s see how that pans out.

Quoting former formula1 driver Daniel Ricciardo cause it fits so perfectly and its true.

"Enjoy the butterflies. Enjoy being naive. Enjoy the nerves, the pressure. 
If you kind of want to stand on the top from day one, then there's nothing else to look forward to. 

Enjoy the process of making a name for yourself, meeting some great people along the way. 
There's a lot of worldly people that you can laugh with, learn from and enjoy moments together. 

Embrace the good ones, stay focused, don't be too far off your path, just keep trying to build and grow, and learn from yourself."
