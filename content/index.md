I'm a software engineer working at [RavenMail](https://ravenmail.io/) on the most advanced email security suite.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently hacking on following stuff: 
  * My golang learnings and exploration: [gosushi](https://github.com/PaulisMatrix/gosushi)
  * Same but around cloud native world: [docker-dump](https://github.com/PaulisMatrix/docker-dump)
  * go-concurrency challenge along with problems around semaphores/mutexes, to understand concurrency in golang and in general: [concurrency](https://github.com/PaulisMatrix/go-concurrency-exercises)
  * Few [contributions](https://github.com/PaulisMatrix/go-caskdb/tree/final) to this excellent project [caskdb](https://github.com/avinassh/py-caskdb/commits/master/) of building a kvstore based on the [bitcask](https://riak.com/assets/bitcask-intro.pdf) paper.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Anything related to distributed systems, databases or containerization tools. You can find my fav projects [here](https://github.com/PaulisMatrix?tab=stars).
