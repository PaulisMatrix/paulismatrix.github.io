  I'm a software engineer working at [Gojek/Goto](https://www.gojek.io/) in the Data Science Platform and Engineering team.
  
  Currently developing AI-based applications by leveraging GoTo's In-house [LLM Sahabat AI](https://sahabat-ai.com/en).
  
  My interests(in no particular order) lie in distributed systems, databases, infra, mythology, sci-fi, 
  world history - ([goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/149694972-rushikesh)) and now GPUs. > > 
  
  
  Hiee, Yup, that's me fixing tests!!(IKR)
